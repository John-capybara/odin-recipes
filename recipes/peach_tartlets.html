    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A ham and cheese sandwich is a classic and satisfying choice. It features slices of ham and cheese between bread, often with additional toppings like lettuce, tomato, or condiments for extra flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 large peaches, each cut into 8 wedges)</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie pastry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>Whisk sugar and Chinese five-spice powder together in a small bowl. Beat egg and water together in another bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When the butter foams, arrange peaches in a single layer in the skillet. Pour sugar mixture over the peaches; cook, turning peaches once, until sugar is melted, bubbling, and syrup has a tan color, about 2 minutes. Transfer peaches and syrup to a bowl to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Cut pie crusts into eight 4 1/2-inch rounds. Set rounds on prepared baking sheet and fold edges of each crust up to form a 1/2-inch rim. Brush each crust with egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Place 2 peach slices, pit-sides facing each other, in the center of each tart. Place 1 peach slice in center, skin-side up, in between the other two peaches. Drizzle excess syrup over the peaches.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
